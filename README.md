### Client-Side

The client side of the application is built using the FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) architecture. It is implemented with the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **Shadcn**: A design system for React.
- **i18n**: Internationalization support.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A toolset for efficient Redux development.

### Server-Side

The server side follows a microservices architecture with a modular structure, particularly in the `Hunting` microservice. Key technologies and patterns used include:

- **.NET 8**: The latest version of Microsoft's .NET framework.
- **Ocelot**: A .NET API Gateway.
- **Onion Architecture**: A layered architecture to enforce separation of concerns.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: A pattern to separate read and write operations.
- **Serilog**: A logging library.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An ORM for database operations.
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for logging and monitoring.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store.
- **MS SQL Server**: A relational database management system.
- **MediatR**: A library for handling requests and notifications.
